Representation of the concept of an identified discrete almost homogenous geological feature with either an irregular solid or 'Yabuki' top surface shape or a regular voxel cubic shape. A stratum is represented as a discrete entity, specialised (sub typed) from [<font color="#0000ff"><u>IfcElement</u></font>]($element://{B8038DA1-0F9B-4585-AF55-52C23EBB33CD}). A stratum may be broken down into smaller entities if properties vary across the stratum or alternatively properties may be described with bounded numeric ranges. A stratum may carry information about the physical form and its interpretation as a Geological Item (GML).
The shape representations used should correspond to the sub-type of [<font color="#0000ff"><u>IfcGeotechnicalAssembly</u></font>]($element://{85B77FDE-67EA-40a4-ADA4-ADD4C95A7D3E}) in which it occurs
