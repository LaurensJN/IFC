A signal is an active device that conveys information or instructions to users, by means of an audio, visual signal or a combination of both.
The primary distinction from an [<font color="#0000ff"><u>IfcSign</u></font>]($element://{4BE0513F-EDAF-4911-92C7-421EA6CD62A3}) is that a signal is active and therefore a subtype of [<font color="#0000ff"><u>IfcFlowTerminal</u></font>]($element://{AE61BBF2-82B0-4caf-B137-1EBEB79B2BB6}) usually requiring power and data connections for its operation.
An instance of [<font color="#0000ff"><u>IfcSignal</u></font>]($element://{15911371-83A2-4660-B0A2-B479E9560615}) represents a singular signalling device in a larger assembled unit or connected system, such as an individual frame within a railway signal, a single light unit in a traffic light system or an audio signal or light mounted on a navigational buoy.
Signals can be physically aggregated together into an assembly which can include multiple signal instances (and also sign instances) and the associated supporting structural elements such as a simple pole or a rigid frame gantry (see Signal Assembly for examples).
Signals can be logically (functionally) grouped together into a signalling system (a type of distribution system) to represent a connected  group of signals for example a group of traffic lights controlling an road intersection.
