	<Documentation>A track circuit is an electric circuit of which the rails of a track section form a part, with usually a source of current connected at one end and a detection device at the other end for detecting whether this track section is clear or occupied by a vehicle. In a continuous signalling system, the track circuit can be used to transmit information between the ground and the train.
