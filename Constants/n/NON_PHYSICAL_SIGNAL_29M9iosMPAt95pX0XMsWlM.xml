	<Documentation>A virtual or fictitious signal. As opposed to the physical signal, the non-physical signal does not need to send information to the train. E.g. a fictitious signal on the signalman&apos;s display needed to define the route exit towards open line where there&apos;s no real signal. A virtual ERTMS L2 signal is also a non-physical signal but can have a physical presence, i.e. a stop marker board along the track.</Documentation>
